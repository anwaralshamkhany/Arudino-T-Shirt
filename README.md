# Arudino-T-Shirt Purpose
The purpose of this project is to create a T-Shirt capable of measuring targeted muscle flex where 3 nodes to measure the muscle flex are embedded into the T-shirt. Some practical applications would be the T-shirts capabilities of measuring to muscle flexion in order to ensure that you are exercising certain muscles when exercising or therapy. The T-shirt uses a spark fun myo ware sensor that has 3 nodes to measure a muscle. you can use an extension cord to place the nodes in different areas such as the back.

# Materials Needed
* Sparkfun myoware sensor https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14409
* Adafruit Flora
* Adafruit bluefruit
* Conductive thread
* sewable conductive buttons
* Tight sweatshirt
* 500 mAH lipo battery
* 2 meters of normal fabric thread

# Instructions to build
Put the shirt inside out and sew 7 buttons in a circular pattern to match that of the adafruit flora. Then sew 4 buttons placed slightly further away from the flora. Then use conductive thread in order to wire the flora like this:

We will then solder the button capes to the flora so that they can easily click in to the shirt and become removeable when you put the shirt for wash in the laundry machine. After that we will solder the myoware sensor directly to the flora, since the flora is removable we do not need to add more buttons. The end result should look like this:
