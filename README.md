# Arudino-T-Shirt Purpose
The purpose of this project is to create a T-Shirt capable of measuring targeted muscle flex where 3 nodes to measure the muscle flex are embedded into the T-shirt. Some practical applications would be the T-shirts capabilities of measuring to muscle flexion in order to ensure that you are exercising certain muscles when exercising or therapy. The T-shirt uses a spark fun myo ware sensor that has 3 nodes to measure a muscle. you can use an extension cord to place the nodes in different areas such as the back.

# Materials Needed
* Sparkfun myoware sensor
* Adafruit Flora
* Adafruit bluefruit
* Conductive thread
* sewable conductive buttons
* Tight sweatshirt
* 500 mAH lipo battery
* 2 meters of normal fabric thread

# Instructions to build
Put the shirt inside out and sew 7 buttons in a circular pattern to match that of the adafruit flora. Then sew 4 buttons placed slightly further away from the flora. Then use conductive thread in order to wire the flora like this:
